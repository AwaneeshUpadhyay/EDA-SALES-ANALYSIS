# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL**
to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, trends, and extract
meaningful business insights before advanced analysis.

---

## 🔹 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to:
- Understand the data structure
- Identify patterns and trends
- Detect missing values or anomalies
- Generate initial business insights

EDA helps in making informed decisions before building dashboards or models.

---

## 🔹 Dataset & Project Materials
- Dataset provided in CSV format
- Imported into a SQL database for analysis
- Contains both categorical (dimensions) and numerical (measures) fields

---

## 🔹 Dimensions & Measures
- **Dimensions**: Descriptive or categorical fields such as date, region, product, or category  
- **Measures**: Numerical fields such as sales, profit, quantity, or revenue  

This separation helps in structuring analytical queries effectively.

---

## 🔹 Database Exploration
Initial exploration of the database included:
- Counting total records
- Understanding column structure
- Checking for missing or null values
- Validating data types

This step ensures data quality before performing deeper analysis.

---

## 🔹 Dimensions Exploration
Categorical columns were analyzed to understand:
- Unique values in each dimension
- Distribution across regions, products, and categories
- Business segmentation

This analysis helps in understanding how data is distributed across key dimensions.

---

## 🔹 Date Exploration
Date-based analysis was performed to:
- Identify the time range of the data
- Analyze yearly and monthly trends
- Detect seasonality patterns

This step provides insights into business performance over time.

---

## 🔹 Measures Exploration
Numerical columns were analyzed to understand:
- Total and average values
- Minimum and maximum values
- Overall performance metrics

This analysis helps in identifying outliers and understanding business scale.

---

## 🔹 Magnitude Analysis
Aggregated analysis was performed to measure business impact:
- Sales by region
- Profit by category
- Contribution of different segments

This step helps identify high-performing and low-performing areas.

---

## 🔹 Ranking Analysis
Ranking analysis was performed to identify:
- Top-performing products
- Top regions by sales or profit
- Bottom-performing segments

SQL techniques such as sorting and ranking logic were used to derive insights.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
- CSV Dataset
- GitHub

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain regions contribute significantly to overall sales
- Seasonal trends are visible in date-based analysis
- A small number of products generate a large portion of revenue
- Ranking analysis highlights top and bottom performers

## 🔹 How to Use This Project
1. Import the CSV dataset into your SQL database
2. Run SQL scripts in a logical sequence
3. Analyze the output to derive insights
